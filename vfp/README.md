# Visual FoxPro Solution

So, you're looking at some code. It's terms are anctient and foreign. Yup.

If you decide to run this `prg` you will need to download the Visual FoxPro 9 sp2 libraries. [https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=13959](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=13959).

You will also need to download the tool vRunFox from Ed Leaf's website. [http://leafe.com/dls/vfp](http://leafe.com/dls/vfp) Look for vRunFox 9. vRunFox is a command line (dare I say REPL) for FoxPro 9.

Once that has been downloaded and the libraries installed, you can run vRunFox and `cd` to the directory containing the `opening-hours.prg`. Then type `do opening-hours` and hit enter. You should be greeted with a MessageBox. Yay!
